"Hey, Nate, how's life?"
I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (last night)
"I'm sorry", that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my car, take a new route
